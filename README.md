## Overview

The Flutter Email OTP application allows users to receive a secure one-time password through email for verification purposes. This can be useful for applications that require an extra layer of security during sign-up or sensitive transactions. The OTP is generated and sent using a dedicated [Email-OTP API](https://github.com/noyon-360/Email-OTP-API) hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com/).

## Features

- **Email Delivery:** Sends the OTP directly to the user's email.
- **Verify OTP:** Validates the OTP entered by the user to ensure authenticity.
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback in case of incorrect OTP or issues in OTP generation.
